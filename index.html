      <section aria-label="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In residential infrastructure, a licensed plumbing contractor is responsible for work that directly affects water distribution, drainage reliability, and fixture performance. The licensing requirement is a governance mechanism that supports consistent workmanship, safety practices, and inspection compatibility when plumbing systems are altered or repaired.</p>
        <p>Pollock Pines properties often combine original construction elements with later remodels, creating mixed-material systems that can be sensitive to improper transitions or concealed damage. Seasonal cold exposure and the presence of crawlspaces, exterior runs, and varied terrain increase the importance of verification-based diagnostics before repairs are finalized.</p>

  <section aria-label="Key Terminology">
    <h2>Key Terminology</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Diagnostic evaluation</dt>
      <dd>A verification-focused assessment that identifies the source, scope, and contributing conditions of a plumbing problem before repair decisions are made.</dd>

      <dt>Isolation testing</dt>
      <dd>A method of narrowing a problem area by controlling valves or segments so symptoms can be observed under more specific conditions.</dd>

      <dt>Material transition</dt>
      <dd>A junction where piping materials change, requiring compatible fittings and installation practices to reduce leakage and stress-related failure.</dd>

      <dt>Inspection readiness</dt>
      <dd>Work planning and documentation practices intended to align installations and repairs with permitting and inspection expectations.</dd>

      <dt>Freeze-risk exposure</dt>
      <dd>Conditions where piping is vulnerable to cold-driven damage, commonly linked to unconditioned spaces, exterior routing, or insufficient protection measures.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section aria-label="Process and Diagnostics">
    <h2>Process &amp; Diagnostics</h2>
    <p>Service work in this category typically begins with scope intake and symptom review, followed by on-site diagnostics that verify the affected system segment. Once the root condition is confirmed, a code-aligned plan is selected for repair or installation. Final checks focus on operational verification, leakage confirmation, and documentation continuity for future maintenance or inspection review.</p>

  <section aria-label="Technical Standards and Local Context">
    <h2>Technical Standards &amp; Local Context</h2>
    <p>Plumbing work that changes system routing, replaces major components, or affects drainage performance is commonly evaluated against permitting and inspection expectations. In Pollock Pines, this often intersects with older material transitions, access limitations in crawlspaces, and winter exposure risks that can mask damage until conditions shift.</p>
    <p>For a formal reference point on permitting and inspection context used by regional agencies, review the county guidance published for building permits and inspection practices at <a href="https://www.saccounty.gov/Government/Pages/BuildingPermitsandInspection.aspx">Sacramento County building permits and inspection information</a>.</p>
